# express-if
School project @INSA-Lyon.

## What is it ?

This application is a real time messenger-like chat made in Java using a thick expressif.client paired with a socket expressif.server. 
This project is from the course **Network Programming** from **INSA Lyon**, it aims to make us practice bare-bones inter-process socket communication in Java.
